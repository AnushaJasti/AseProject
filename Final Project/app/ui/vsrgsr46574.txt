Abstract :
This Project is about comparing prices from different online applications and suggesting the best product from them. Camera integration is done so that the user can take a picture and upload it for searching. Then it displays the list of items that the user needs. In the first Increment, we have designed Login Page, Register Page and Home Page. The user needs to Login first to use the application. The user can login using google, facebook or by using firebase. If the user has no credentials to Login In then He can Register in our application Using Register Activity. After user has Registered and Logged in the user is redirected to the Home Activity where the user can enter the item they require and the user can see the items from different sites.

Implementation :
We created a Login page, where you can login using your google, facebook or our website credentials.

OAuth login is done using google and facebook API’s.

We have created Registration page using the firebase .

In Registration page we check whether the password and confirm password are same or not and the provided mail-id is valid or not.

Then the details are stored in Firebase.

After Logging in the user is directed to home page where we provide text box to enter input and a search button and also includes a button to use the camera for capturing the image of the product to which the user wishes to search for.

We retreive the list of products from two different websites with the use of API namely Walmart and Ebay.

There is also another feature available like the Review option. This allows the user to see the reviews of the product they are searching for written by other users on our application. This button redirects to the Review page for that product and displays all the reviews in the list format which is being retreived form the database. The reviews are being retreived if the product name entered matches with any product name in the reviews database.

Each and every authenticated user has a personal user profile which has the basic details of the user and also provides a chance to write a review for any product they bought personally or would like to review on our application.

On clicking the "Write a Review Button" the user is redirected to the review page and can write review of any product starting with the product name. These reviews are stored in the database and retreived when requested.
