This Project is about comparing prices from different online applications and suggesting the best product from them. Camera integration is done so that the user can take a picture and upload it for searching. Then it displays the list of items that the user needs. In the first Increment, we have designed Login Page, Register Page and Home Page. The user needs to Login first to use the application. The user can login using google, facebook or by using firebase. If the user has no credentials to Login In then He can Register in our application Using Register Activity. After user has Registered and Logged in the user is redirected to the Home Activity where the user can enter the item they require and the user can see the items from different sites.

Implementation:

We created a Login page, where you can login using your google, facebook or our website credentials.

OAuth login is done using google and facebook API’s.

We have created Registration page using the firebase .

In Registration page we check whether the password and confirm password are same or not and the provided mail-id is valid or not.

Then the details are stored in Firebase.

After Logging in the user is directed to home page where we provide text box to enter input and a search button. We also have another page for camera integration where the user can take a picture and upload it and search according to that.
